                <h1>Take Me Home, Country Roads</h1>
                <h2>John Denver (1943-1997)</h2>

                <p><b>Almost heaven, West Virginia</b>
                    <br>Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
                    <br>Life is old there, older than the trees
                    <br>Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze</p>

                <p>Country roads, take me home
                    <br>To the place I belong
                    <br>West Virginia, mountain momma
                    <br>Take me home, country roads</p>

                <p>All my memories, gather 'round her
                    <br>Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
                    <br>Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
                    <br>Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye</p>

                <p>Country roads, take me home
                    <br>To the place I belong
                    <br>West Virginia, mountain momma
                    <br>Take me home, country roads</p>

                <p>I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
                    <br>The radio reminds me of my home far away
                    <br>Drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
                    <br>That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday</p>

                <p>Country roads, take me home
                    <br>To the place I belong
                    <br>West Virginia, mountain momma
                    <br>Take me home, country roads</p>
